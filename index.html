                A chair or seliri is a household item that is used as a seat. In general, a chair has 4 legs which are
                used to support the weight of the body on it. Some types of chairs, such as barstools, only have 1 leg
                located in the middle. There are several chairs equipped with leg supports.
                Folding chairs are an example of a type of chair that is quite well known. It is called a folding chair
                because this chair can be folded when not in use so it is more practical when stored. Based on their
                structure, folding chairs can be divided into 2 types, namely folding table chairs and folding chairs
                without tables. Each type of folding chair has different benefits and uses. <br>
                <br>
                Some of the 4-legged chairs currently being made have such a perfect design structure that they can even
                support loads of more than 500 kilograms.
                In its use, chairs are used to sit on body parts or as support for other parts. Chairs are also widely
                used in daily life in government, education, social, economic and other fields. So chairs have important
                benefits in life.<br>
